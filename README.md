# Condorcet-Jury-Theorem-Simulations
Watts-Strogatz small world network simulation of CJT with network effects. 

This is the supporting code for computational simulations of the Condorcet Jury Theorem with voter induced correlation via discussion and opinion leaders for a paper assessing whether epistemic democracy holds and thus an instrumentalist justification of democracy. The network model employed is a type of Watts-Strogatz small world network model.  

Note, the example Jupyter notebook attached uses smaller parameters (like less voters and model iterations) in comparison to the final paper for run time reasons.
